# AssetStudio LuaScripts

This repo is an adjunct to the fork repository [Studio](https://github.com/AXiX-official/Studio). In this fork version added the feature of using lua scripts to preprocess files, in this repo will include all kinds of preprocessing lua scripts to decrypt ab file data.

## LuaScripts

- [offset.lua](./Scripts/offset.lua)
    Preprocess the file by skipping the extra data copied before the file header.

## Contribution

I will be very grateful if you can contribute to this repo by providing more preprocessing lua scripts.
